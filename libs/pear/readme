This directory contains the minimalistic set of PEAR packages that are
required by EZPDO. 

This is an attempt to make EZPDO a self-contained package as requested
by many EZPDO users. To avoid multiple declarations of classes, we have
modified the class names by adding prefix "epLib_". 

All credits are due to the original authors of the packages. The
original licences and copyrights should be respected and retained.
